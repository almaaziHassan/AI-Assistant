-- Baseline migration for existing database
-- This migration was created to mark the existing database schema as the baseline.
-- The actual tables already exist in the database, so this migration is empty.
-- Prisma will use this as the starting point for future migrations.

-- Tables that exist:
-- staff, services, locations, appointments, holidays, conversations, waitlist, callbacks, staff_services
